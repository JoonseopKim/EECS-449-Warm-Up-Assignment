# JoonseopKim-EECS-449-Warm-Up-Assignment

This exercise was an interesting code-along project. This is the first time I used jaclang and build the conversational AI. Although the spec had some detailed guidance, there are some room for improvements possible as described in the extra credit section. One of the most notable problem would be typos in the code script, which brings errors and make students like me confused. Additionally, adding some warnings for common mistakes and explaining common error messages could be helpful for students to debug their work. Nevertheless, this project was a great starter project to build my cute conversation AI using chatGPT API. I did spent 5 dollars to get access to API, but it was a good money spent for this project. I am looking forward to implement these concepts to my capstone project.
